enable developer mode by going to :

it will ask for permission for the computer .


Unity :
go to :
File --> build settings --> add the scenes --> choose android platfrom --> click switch platform .
got to player setting in the lower left corner of the build settings 
choose the android icon
under the window " OTHER SETTINGS " do as follow :
remove the vulkan graphic .
uncheck the multithreaded Rendering .
change Package name .
change Minimum API Level to (API level 26).


now you are set 
go back to the build settings and press build and run 
choose where to put the build and wait for the app to run on the phone .

Thank you .
