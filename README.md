# 3d-ar-find-hide

This is my first approach to virtual reality on Unity , i Used AR Foundation to create the application and build it. it was built for android devices since i have one and i need to test how things work.

the Game is About placing and finding objects between two players during lockdown , using simple logic like rays , objects arrays , collision , simple animations.
