# 3d-ar-find-hide

 # Introduction #
 
This is my first approach to virtual reality on Unity , i Used *AR Foundation* to create the application and build it. it was built for *Android* devices since i have one and i need to test how things work.

the Game is About placing and finding objects between two players during lockdown , using simple logic like rays , objects arrays , collision , simple animations.

## User Interface ##
* I used some simple Ui :
  * Uploaded existing free templates of buttons to use them
  * text fonts from fonts 1001
  * colored them with gradiant coloring effect
  *  one canvas for everything.

## * Inside the Game ##
* **I will give you some simple explanation about the inside of the game **:
  * I used the primitive shapes inside unity since it is a prototype
  * I created simple materials with in built colors to add some diversity between the objects 
  * As u can see there is an indicator *Blue Circle* that works through projecting rays from the center of the camera to the ground 
* **How the game works :**
  * First the player starts the game and calibrates to show the indicator 
  * _First player_ places objects on the ground before the timer is down to zero 
  * A *Button* shows up to change to the *Second Player* 
  * *Second Player* need to find all objects before the timer is down to zero.
